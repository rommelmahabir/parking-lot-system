# PARKING LOT MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
This is my first project in my introduction to data structures course at UNT - CSCE 2110.

# DESCRIPTION
This program was designed to allow different levels of users (admin, management, user) log in to a parking lot management system. Based on their ID's they were given access to a specific menu with options based on their user level. Admins are allowed to add, delete, or change user information, users can manipulate information on their specific account as well as appeal and pay tickets, while management had the authorization to do all of the above, adjudicate appeals, and issue tickets.
